# Moreover, if want to test whatsapp's webhook locally, you can use zrok on a reserved URL with a zrok "share token" 
# obtained by contacting its current holder: https://github.com/OdyAsh (source 1, 2 below)
# Alternatively, you can change the webhook url all together (source 3, 4 below)
# Check these sources for more details: 
# Source 1: https://dev.to/odyash/quickly-share-your-app-with-zrok-4ihp
# Source 2: https://openziti.discourse.group/t/how-do-i-use-a-reserved-share-on-different-devices/2379/2
# Source 3: https://youtu.be/KP6_BUw3i0U?t=1294 
#   (@21:33 and 25:30, however they use glitch instead of zrok, so you'll just need to change the webhook url to your zrok url)
# Source 4 (where you can change callback url, given that your facebook account gets access by the app's admins): 
#   https://developers.facebook.com/apps/871020755148175/whatsapp-business/wa-settings/
#   Note 1: Obviously, that `871...175` is the testing app's public id, so if this link still doesn't work even after you gain access, 
#   then the admins most probably created a new test app instance
#   Note 2: If an unexpected 3rd party discovers the ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN, 
#   a new one will have to be generated, then added to Meta's callback URL of the *testing* app
#   (Noting that the *production* app's callback URL will be different anyway, so the 3rd party won't be able to access that app)
#   (but we still don't want random calls to be made to our testing app, so that's why we'll still have to change an exposed token :])
