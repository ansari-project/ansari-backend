#   Watch Until 32:25, while quickly skimming through the non-python code parts
# Source 2 (mentioned in video above): https://glitch.com/edit/#!/insidious-tartan-alvarezsaurus
#           (the `verification_webhook` endpoint in `main_whatsapp` is inspired by the above URL)

# Moreover, if want to test whatsapp's webhook locally, you can use zrok on a reserved URL with a zrok "share token"
# obtained by contacting its current holder: https://github.com/OdyAsh (source 1, 2 below)
# Alternatively, you can change the webhook url all together (source 3, 4 below)
# Check these sources for more details:
# Source 1: https://dev.to/odyash/quickly-share-your-app-with-zrok-4ihp
# Source 2: https://openziti.discourse.group/t/how-do-i-use-a-reserved-share-on-different-devices/2379/2
# Source 3: https://youtu.be/KP6_BUw3i0U?t=1294
#   (@21:33 and 25:30, however they use glitch instead of zrok, so the video here is just to give you an idea how to setup a webhook)
# Source 4 (where you can change callback url, given that your facebook account gets access by the app's admins):
#   https://developers.facebook.com/apps/871020755148175/whatsapp-business/wa-settings/
#   NOTE 1: When you see the `Callback URL`, it will be something like "https://ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN.share.zrok.io/whatsapp/v1"
#           (The `/whatsapp/v1` endpoint can be found in `main_whatsapp.py`'s endpoints, that's why it's in the url above)
#   NOTE 2: If an unexpected 3rd party discovers the ZROK_SHARE_TOKEN,
#   a new one will have to be generated, then added to Meta's callback URL of the *testing* app
#   (Noting that the *production* app's callback URL will be different anyway, so the 3rd party won't be able to access that app)
#   (but we still don't want random calls to be made to our testing app, so that's why we'll still have to change an exposed token :])
#   NOTE 3: Obviously, that `871...175` in the above URL is the testing app's public id, so if this link still doesn't work even after you gain access,
#   then the admins most probably created a new test app instance
