## Usage

To use this template for architect-mediated reviews:

```bash
# Fill out this template and save as overview.md, then:
consult --model gemini pr 68 --context overview.md

# Or pipe directly:
cat overview.md | consult --model gemini pr 68 --context -

# For 3-way parallel reviews:
consult --model gemini pr 68 --context overview.md &
consult --model codex pr 68 --context overview.md &
consult --model claude pr 68 --context overview.md &
wait
```
