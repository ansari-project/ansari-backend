# Experiment ####: Name

**Status**: In Progress | Complete | Disproved | Aborted

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD

## Goal

What are you trying to learn or test? Be specific about:
- The question you're answering
- The hypothesis you're testing
- Success criteria (how will you know if it worked?)

## Effort

**Approximate time spent**: [e.g., "4 hours"]

*(Optional: Break down into setup, coding, analysis if helpful)*

## Approach

Brief description of the approach being tested:
- Key technique or method
- Why this approach was chosen
- Any alternatives considered

## Environment & Reproduction

**How to run**:
```bash
# Command to reproduce results
python experiment.py --input data/input/sample.json
```

**Dependencies** (if different from main project):
- List any additional packages required
- Or reference: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Environment notes**:
- Python version, key library versions if relevant
- Any seeds or configuration needed for reproducibility

## Code

List your experiment files:
- [`experiment.py`](experiment.py) - Brief description
- [Other files as needed]

## Results

### Summary

One-paragraph summary of key findings.

### Key Findings

1. **Finding one**: Description and significance
2. **Finding two**: Description and significance
3. **Finding three**: Description and significance

### Metrics

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Metric 1 | Value | Context |
| Metric 2 | Value | Context |

### Output Files

- `data/output/results.csv` - Raw results data

## What Worked

- List things that went well
- Approaches that proved effective
- Useful discoveries

## What Didn't Work

- Failed approaches (and why)
- Dead ends encountered
- Surprising obstacles

## Next Steps

Based on these findings:

1. **Immediate**: What should happen right after this experiment?
2. **Follow-up experiments**: What new questions emerged?
3. **Production path**: If validated, what's needed for production? (SPIR spec?)
