# MAINTAIN Protocol

## Overview

MAINTAIN is a periodic maintenance protocol for keeping codebases healthy. It runs as a **strict porch protocol** with sequential phases and 3-way consultation (Gemini, Codex, Claude) at each phase.

**Core Principle**: Regular maintenance prevents technical debt accumulation.

**Key Documents**: MAINTAIN is responsible for keeping these living documents accurate and consistent:
- `codev/resources/arch.md` - Architecture documentation (how the system works)
- `codev/resources/lessons-learned.md` - Extracted wisdom from reviews

Any builder can update these files during development, but MAINTAIN ensures they stay consistent with the actual codebase.

## When to Use MAINTAIN

- When the user/architect requests it
- Before a release (clean slate for shipping)
- Quarterly maintenance window
- After completing a major feature
- When the codebase feels "crusty"

## Execution Model

MAINTAIN is orchestrated by porch with 4 sequential phases:

```
af spawn --protocol maintain
    ↓
1. AUDIT: Scan for dead code, unused deps, stale docs
    ↓ (3-way review)
2. CLEAN: Remove identified cruft
    ↓ (3-way review + build/test checks)
3. SYNC: Update documentation
    ↓ (3-way review)
4. VERIFY: Final validation + PR
    ↓ (3-way review)
PR with maintenance changes
    ↓
Architect reviews → Merge
```

Each phase goes through build-verify cycles with 3-way consultation before proceeding.

## Prerequisites

Before starting MAINTAIN:
1. Check `codev/maintain/` for last maintenance run
2. Note the base commit from that run
3. Focus on changes since that commit: `git log --oneline <base-commit>..HEAD`

---

## Maintenance Files

Each maintenance run creates a numbered file in `codev/maintain/`:

```
codev/maintain/
├── 0001.md
├── 0002.md
└── ...
```

**Template**: `codev/protocols/maintain/templates/maintenance-run.md`

The file records:
- Base commit (starting point)
- Tasks completed
- Findings and deferred items
- Summary

## Task Details

### Update arch.md

Scan the actual codebase and update `codev/resources/arch.md`:

**Discovery phase**:
1. `git log --oneline <base-commit>..HEAD` - what changed since last maintenance
2. `ls -R` key directories to find new files/modules
3. `grep` for new exports, classes, key functions
4. Review new/modified specs: `git diff <base-commit>..HEAD --name-only -- codev/specs/`
5. Review new/modified plans: `git diff <base-commit>..HEAD --name-only -- codev/plans/`

**Update arch.md**:
1. Verify directory structure matches documented structure
2. Update component descriptions for changed modules
3. Add new utilities/helpers discovered
4. Remove references to deleted code
5. Update technology stack if dependencies changed
6. Document new integration points or APIs
7. Capture architectural decisions from new specs/plans

**Primary sources** (specs/plans):
- Architectural decisions from specs
- Component relationships from plans
- Design rationale and tradeoffs

**Secondary sources** (code):
- File locations and their purpose
- Key functions/classes and what they do
- Data flow and dependencies
- Configuration options
- CLI commands and flags

**What NOT to include**:
- Implementation details that change frequently
- Line numbers (they go stale)
- Full API documentation (use JSDoc/docstrings for that)

**Primary Purpose**: arch.md should enable a developer (or AI agent) to rapidly understand the entire system - not just file locations, but **how things actually work**.

**Recommended Document Structure**:
```markdown
# Project Architecture

## Overview
[High-level description: what the system does, core design philosophy, 2-3 sentences]

## Quick Start for Developers
[The fastest path to understanding: "To understand X, read Y first"]

## Technology Stack
[Technologies, frameworks, key dependencies with versions]

## Directory Structure
[Complete directory tree with explanations for each major directory]

## Major Components

### [Component Name] (e.g., Agent Farm)
- **Purpose**: What problem it solves
- **Location**: path/to/component
- **How It Works**:
  - Step-by-step explanation of the mechanism
  - Key technologies used (e.g., "uses tmux for terminal multiplexing")
  - Runtime behavior (e.g., "spawns a tmux session per builder")
  - State management (e.g., "state stored in SQLite at .agent-farm/state.db")
- **Key Files**:
  - `file.ts` - does X
  - `other.ts` - handles Y
- **Configuration**: How to customize behavior
- **Common Operations**: Examples of typical usage

[Repeat for each major component - be thorough about HOW, not just WHAT]

## Utility Functions & Helpers
### [Utility Category]
- **File**: path/to/utility.ts
- **Functions**: `functionName()` - Description and use case
- **When to Use**: Guidance on appropriate usage

## Data Flow
[How data moves through the system, with concrete examples]

## Key Design Decisions
[Important architectural choices and their rationale - the WHY]

## Integration Points
[External services, APIs, databases, and how they connect]

## Development Patterns
[Common patterns used throughout the codebase]
```

**Critical: The "How It Works" Requirement**

For each major component, arch.md MUST explain the implementation mechanism, not just the purpose. Examples of good vs bad:

| Bad (just WHAT) | Good (includes HOW) |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "Agent Farm manages builders" | "Agent Farm spawns builders in isolated git worktrees. Each builder runs in a tmux session (named `builder-{id}`). The dashboard uses ttyd to expose terminals via HTTP on ports 4201-4299. State is persisted in SQLite." |
| "Consult tool queries AI models" | "Consult shells out to external CLIs (gemini-cli, codex, claude). It writes the consultant role to a temp file, sets environment variables, and streams stdout/stderr back to the user." |

This level of detail enables rapid onboarding and debugging.

**Content Quality Standards**:
- **Be Specific**: Include exact file paths, actual function names, concrete examples
- **Maintain Accuracy**: Cross-reference specs/plans with actual implementation; flag discrepancies
- **Optimize for Quick Understanding**: Use clear hierarchy, highlight commonly used components
- **Stay Current**: Reflect actual state, not aspirational; remove deprecated components

**Special Attention Areas**:

1. **Utility Functions** (critical for productivity):
   - Document every utility function with exact location
   - Explain what each does and when to use it
   - Include parameter types and return types

2. **Directory Structure** (often first thing referenced):
   - Keep directory tree up-to-date and complete
   - Explain purpose of each major directory
   - Highlight where specific types of files should be placed

3. **Integration Points** (critical for understanding system boundaries):
   - Document all external dependencies and APIs
   - Explain how different parts connect
   - Note special configuration requirements

**Quality Assurance Before Finalizing**:
- [ ] All file paths are correct and current
- [ ] All documented functions actually exist
- [ ] Directory structure matches reality
- [ ] Architectural decisions are accurately represented
- [ ] Document is internally consistent

**Constraints**:
- Never invent structure - only document what exists or is in specs/plans
- Never make architectural decisions - document them, don't make them
- Always verify documentation against actual implementation

### Generate lessons-learned.md

Extract actionable wisdom from review documents into `codev/resources/lessons-learned.md`:

**Discovery phase**:
1. Find new/modified reviews: `git diff <base-commit>..HEAD --name-only -- codev/reviews/`
2. Read each new/modified review file

**Extract from reviews**:
1. Read all files in `codev/reviews/`
2. Extract lessons that are:
   - Actionable (not just "we learned X")
   - Durable (still relevant)
   - General (applicable beyond one project)
3. Organize by topic (Testing, Architecture, Process, etc.)
4. Link back to source review
5. Prune outdated lessons

**Template**:
```markdown
# Lessons Learned

## Testing
- [From 0001] Always use XDG sandboxing in tests to avoid touching real $HOME
- [From 0009] Verify dependencies actually export what you expect

## Architecture
- [From 0008] Single source of truth beats distributed state
- [From 0031] SQLite with WAL mode handles concurrency better than JSON files

## Process
- [From 0001] Multi-agent consultation catches issues humans miss
```

### Sync CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md

Ensure both instruction files contain the same content:

1. Diff the two files
2. Identify divergence
3. Update the stale one to match
4. Both should be identical (per AGENTS.md standard)

### Prune Documentation

**CRITICAL: Documentation pruning requires JUSTIFICATION for every deletion.**

Size targets (~400 lines for CLAUDE.md/README.md) are **guidelines, not mandates**. Never sacrifice clarity or important content just to hit a line count.

**Before deleting ANY content, document:**
1. **What** is being removed (quote or summarize)
2. **Why** it's being removed:
   - `OBSOLETE` - References deleted code/features
   - `DUPLICATIVE` - Same info exists elsewhere (cite location)
   - `MOVED` - Relocated to another file (cite new location)
   - `VERBOSE` - Can be condensed without losing meaning
3. **Decision** - Delete, move, or keep with note

**Create a deletion log in your maintenance file:**
```markdown
## Documentation Changes

### arch.md
| Section | Action | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| "Old API docs" | DELETED | OBSOLETE - API removed in v1.2 |
| "Installation" | MOVED | To INSTALL.md for brevity |
| "Architecture patterns" | KEPT | Still relevant, referenced by builders |
```

**Files to review**:
- `codev/resources/arch.md` - remove references to deleted code/modules
- `codev/resources/lessons-learned.md` - remove outdated lessons
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` - target ~400 lines (guideline, not hard limit)
- `README.md` - target ~400 lines (guideline, not hard limit)

**Conservative approach**:
- When in doubt, KEEP the content
- If unsure, ASK the architect before deleting
- Prefer MOVING over DELETING
- Never delete "development patterns" or "best practices" sections without explicit approval

**What to extract (move, don't delete)**:
- Detailed command references → `codev/resources/commands/`
- Protocol details → `codev/protocols/*/protocol.md`
- Tool configuration → `codev/resources/`

**What to ALWAYS keep in CLAUDE.md**:
- Git prohibitions and safety rules
- Critical workflow instructions
- Protocol selection guidance
- Consultation requirements
- Links to detailed docs

**Good candidates for deletion from CLAUDE.md**:
- Content duplicated elsewhere (e.g., in protocol files, role files, docs/)
- **When removing duplicated content**: Replace with a pointer to the canonical location
  ```markdown
  ## Consult Tool

  See `codev/resources/commands/consult.md` for full documentation.
  ```
- This keeps CLAUDE.md as an index/guide rather than duplicating detailed docs

### Remove Dead Code

Use static analysis to find and remove unused code:

1. Run analysis tools (ts-prune, depcheck, ruff)
2. Review findings for false positives
3. Use `git rm` to remove confirmed dead code
4. Commit with descriptive message

**Important**: Use `git rm`, not `rm`. Git history preserves deleted files.

### Update Dependencies

Review and update outdated dependencies:

1. Run `npm outdated` or equivalent
2. Categorize updates:
   - Patch: Safe to auto-update
   - Minor: Review changelog
   - Major: Requires human review for breaking changes
3. Update and test
4. Document any migration steps

### Run codev update

Update the codev framework to the latest version:

```bash
codev update
```

This updates protocols, templates, and agents while preserving your specs, plans, and reviews.

---

## Validation

After completing tasks, validate the codebase:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] No import/module errors
- [ ] Documentation links resolve
- [ ] Linter passes

If validation fails, investigate and fix before creating PR.

---

## 3-Way Review (Before PR)

After completing all tasks and validation, run a 3-way consultation review:

```bash
# Run all three in parallel
consult --model gemini --type impl-review pr <branch-name> &
consult --model codex --type impl-review pr <branch-name> &
consult --model claude --type impl-review pr <branch-name> &
wait
```

**Focus areas for maintenance review:**
- Are deletions justified and documented?
- Is arch.md accurate and complete?
- Are lessons-learned.md entries actionable?
- Any regressions or side effects?

**Verdicts:**
- All APPROVE → Create PR
- Any REQUEST_CHANGES → Address feedback, re-run review
- Conflicting opinions → Use judgment, document decision

Only create the PR after the 3-way review passes.

---

## Rollback Strategy

### For code changes
```bash
# Git history preserves everything
git log --all --full-history -- path/to/file
git checkout <commit>~1 -- path/to/file
```

### For untracked files
Move to `codev/maintain/.trash/YYYY-MM-DD/` before deleting. Retained for 30 days.

---

## Commit Messages

```
[Maintain] Remove 5 unused exports
[Maintain] Update arch.md with new utilities
[Maintain] Generate lessons-learned.md
[Maintain] Sync CLAUDE.md with AGENTS.md
[Maintain] Update dependencies (patch)
```

---

## Governance

MAINTAIN is an **operational protocol**, not a feature development protocol:

| Document | Required? |
|----------|-----------|
| Spec | No |
| Plan | No |
| Review | No |
| 3-Way Consultation | **Yes** (before creating PR) |

**Exception**: If MAINTAIN reveals need for architectural changes, those should follow SPIR.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Don't be aggressive**: When in doubt, KEEP the content. It's easier to delete later than to recover lost knowledge.
2. **Check git blame**: Understand why code/docs exist before removing
3. **Run full test suite**: Not just affected tests
4. **Group related changes**: One commit per logical change
5. **Document EVERY deletion**: Include what, why, and where (if moved)
6. **Ask when unsure**: Consult architect before removing "important-looking" content
7. **Prefer moving over deleting**: Extract to another file rather than removing entirely
8. **Size targets are guidelines**: Never sacrifice clarity to hit a line count

---

## Anti-Patterns

1. **Aggressive rewriting without explanation**: "I condensed it" is not a reason
2. **Deleting without documenting why**: Every deletion needs justification in the maintenance file
3. **Hitting line count targets at all costs**: 400 lines is a guideline, not a mandate
4. **Removing "patterns" or "best practices" sections**: These are high-value content
5. **Deleting everything the audit finds**: Review each item individually
6. **Skipping validation**: "It looked dead/obsolete" is not validation
7. **Using `rm` instead of `git rm`**: Lose history
8. **Making changes the architect can't review**: Big deletions need clear explanations
