# Ansari Guide

Ansari is a chatbot designed to help answer non-Muslims' questions about Islam and to help Muslims strengthen their faith. This guide helps teach you what Ansari can do. 

## Key points before we go any further

- Ansari is not perfect. It can and will make mistakes. 
- We have gone to some trouble to validate that it does say things that are *mostly* correct. We have reviewed over 2,500 user interactions. Of those questions, we found 8 that we weren't sure were correct or not (mostly on fiqh questions like inheritance etc). We sent those 8 to some religious scholars, and it turned out Ansari was correct on all 8. 
- If you see it say something you're not sure about or wrong, just tell Ansari that you want to flag this (as in "I want to flag this") and a human will review the conversation. Or send e-mail to feedback@ansari.chat. 

## What can Ansari do?

### It can answer questions about the Qur'an

You can ask it questions like this: 

<code> 
User: What is the verse that talks about if the oceans were ink and the trees were pens? 

Ansari: The verse that talks about if the oceans were ink and the trees were pens is found in Surah Luqman:

Ayah: 31:27
Arabic: وَلَوْ أَنَّمَا فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مِن شَجَرَةٍ أَقْلَـٰمٌ وَٱلْبَحْرُ يَمُدُّهُۥ مِنۢ بَعْدِهِۦ سَبْعَةُ أَبْحُرٍۢ مَّا نَفِدَتْ كَلِمَـٰتُ ٱللَّهِ ۗ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَزِيزٌ حَكِيمٌ
English: If all the trees on earth were pens and the ocean ˹were ink˺, refilled by seven other oceans, the Words of Allah would not be exhausted. Surely Allah is Almighty, All-Wise.
</code>

```
User: Give me a point by point summary of the last verse of Surah Al Baqarah

Ansari: The last verse of Surah Al-Baqarah (2:286) is a profound verse that encapsulates several key Islamic beliefs and principles. Here is a point-by-point summary:

Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity: This part of the verse emphasizes that Allah is Just and Merciful, and He does not impose on any soul duties and responsibilities beyond its ability to bear.

Each soul will be rewarded for its good deeds: This part of the verse reinforces the concept of individual responsibility and accountability in Islam. It assures that every good action will be rewarded.

Each soul will bear the consequences of its evil deeds: This part of the verse serves as a warning that individuals will also bear the consequences of their wrong actions.

The verse ends with a supplication to Allah: The believers ask Allah not to burden them as He burdened those before them, not to burden them with more than they can bear, to forgive them, to have mercy on them, and to help them against those who disbelieve.
```

### It can suggest dua to say in a particular situation

```
User: What is the dua I should say when I leave home?

Ansari: When leaving home, it is recommended to say the following dua, as taught by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him):

Arabic: بِسْمِ اللهِ، تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللهِ، وَلَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ
English: "In the name of Allah, I place my trust in Allah, and there is no might nor power except with Allah."

This dua is reported in Jami` at-Tirmidhi and other Hadith collections. It is a way of seeking Allah's protection and expressing trust in Him when leaving the safety of one's home.
```

### It can answer basic fiqh questions

```
What are the etiquettes of going to the bathroom in Islam?

Islamic teachings provide guidance on all aspects of life, including personal hygiene and etiquette in the bathroom. Here are some of the key etiquettes based on Hadiths and the teachings of scholars:

1. Entering with the left foot: It is recommended to enter the bathroom with the left foot and to exit with the right foot, as reported in a Hadith narrated by Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) in Sahih Muslim.

2. Seeking refuge in Allah: Before entering the bathroom, it is recommended to say: "Bismillah, Allahumma inni a'udhu bika minal khubuthi wal khaba'ith" (In the name of Allah, O Allah, I seek refuge in You from the male and female unclean spirits).

3. Privacy and modesty: One should ensure privacy and maintain modesty by keeping the body covered as much as possible.

4. Using the left hand for cleaning: It is recommended to use the left hand for cleaning oneself and the right hand for other activities to maintain cleanliness and hygiene.

5. Avoiding soiling clothes: Care should be taken to avoid any splashes or soiling of clothes.

6. Not facing or turning one's back towards the Qibla: While relieving oneself, one should not face or turn their back towards the Qibla (the direction of the Kaaba in Mecca).

7. Cleaning with water: It is highly recommended to clean oneself with water after using the toilet.

8. Not talking: It is recommended to avoid unnecessary talking in the bathroom.

9. Saying a prayer upon exiting: Upon exiting, it is recommended to say "Ghufraanak" (I seek Your forgiveness).

These etiquettes are based on various Hadiths and the teachings of scholars like Imam Nawawi and Ibn Qayyim.
```

### It can provide answers that covers multiple opinions on modern topics

```
User: Is music halal or haram?

Ansari: The issue of music in Islam is a complex one and scholars have different opinions.

Imam Al Ghazali in his book "Ihya Ulum al-Din" argued that music in itself is not haram (prohibited), but it becomes so if it leads to sinful behavior, such as neglecting one's duties towards Allah or indulging in immoral activities.

On the other hand, Ibn Taymiyah, a prominent scholar of the Hanbali school, held a stricter view. He believed that most music is haram, especially if it includes sinful or misleading content.

In the modern era, Sheikh Yusuf Al Qaradawi, in his book "The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam", states that not all music is haram. He argues that music is permissible as long as it does not lead to sinful behavior or thoughts, and does not include any haram content.

It's important to note that all scholars agree that any form of music that includes haram content (such as promoting immorality, sinful behavior, or containing foul language) is prohibited.

As a Muslim, it's important to seek knowledge and make informed decisions based on the Qur'an, Hadith, and the advice of knowledgeable scholars.
```

### It can reassure/console you when you have doubts/worries (with supporting evidence)

```
User: I have really made many major mistakes. Can Allah still forgive me?

Ansari: Yes, Allah can certainly forgive you. The Qur'an repeatedly emphasizes Allah's boundless mercy and forgiveness.

Ayah: 4:106
Arabic Text: وَٱسْتَغْفِرِ ٱللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَانَ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا
English Text: And seek Allah’s forgiveness—indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

Ayah: 5:74
Arabic Text: أَفَلَا يَتُوبُونَ إِلَى ٱللَّهِ وَيَسْتَغْفِرُونَهُۥ ۚ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ
English Text: Will they not turn to Allah in repentance and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

These verses clearly indicate that Allah is All-Forgiving and Most Merciful. No matter how major your mistakes are, if you sincerely repent and seek His forgiveness, Allah can forgive you. It's never too late to turn back to Allah.
```

```
User: Lots of bad things keep happening to me. Does Allah still love me?

Ansari: Yes, Allah's love for His creation is immense and enduring. Experiencing difficulties or trials does not mean that Allah does not love you. In fact, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said in a Hadith recorded by Imam Tirmidhi and Imam Ibn Majah: "When Allah loves a servant, He tests him."

Sheikh Salman Al-Awdah, a contemporary scholar, explains that trials can be a means of purification and a way to attain a higher rank in the sight of Allah. They can also serve as a reminder for us to turn back to Allah and strengthen our relationship with Him.

Remember the words of Allah in the Qur'an:

Ayah: 2:286
Arabic Text: لَا يُكَلِّفُ ٱللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلَّا وُسْعَهَا ۚ لَهَا مَا كَسَبَتْ وَعَلَيْهَا مَا ٱكْتَسَبَتْ ۗ رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَآ إِن نَّسِينَآ أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْنَآ إِصْرًا كَمَا حَمَلْتَهُۥ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِنَا ۚ رَبَّنَا وَلَا تُحَمِّلْنَا مَا لَا طَاقَةَ لَنَا بِهِۦ ۖ وَٱعْفُ عَنَّا وَٱغْفِرْ لَنَا وَٱرْحَمْنَآ ۚ أَنتَ مَوْلَىٰنَا فَٱنصُرْنَا عَلَى ٱلْقَوْمِ ٱلْكَـٰفِرِينَ
English Text: Allah does not burden any soul with more than it can bear. Each will enjoy the good they have earned and suffer the evil they have wrought. O our Lord! Do not punish us if we forget or make a mistake. O our Lord! Do not burden us as You burdened those before us. O our Lord! Do not impose on us what we do not have the strength to bear. Pardon us, forgive us, have mercy on us. You are our Protector, so help us against the disbelieving people.

So, be patient, keep faith in Allah's wisdom and mercy, and remember that every difficulty is an opportunity for growth and spiritual elevation. May Allah ease your difficulties and grant you patience.

### It can help you with Arabic 
```
User: What is the root word of اتستبدلون

Ansari: The root word of اتستبدلون (Tastabdiloon) is ب-د-ل (B-D-L). This root in Arabic carries the basic meaning of changing, substituting, or replacing something.

The word اتستبدلون is in the form of the 10th verb form (Istif'al), which often conveys the meaning of seeking or asking for the action of the root. So, in this case, it would mean "you seek to replace" or "you wish to substitute".

This word is used in the Qur'an in several places, such as in Ayah 2:61 of Surah Al-Baqarah:

Arabic: وَإِذْ قُلْتُمْ يَا مُوسَىٰ لَن نَّصْبِرَ عَلَىٰ طَعَامٍ وَاحِدٍ فَادْعُ لَنَا رَبَّكَ يُخْرِجْ لَنَا مِمَّا تُنبِتُ الْأَرْضُ مِن بَقْلِهَا وَقِثَّائِهَا وَفُومِهَا وَعَدَسِهَا وَبَصَلِهَا ۖ قَالَ أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ الَّذِي هُوَ أَدْنَىٰ بِالَّذِي هُوَ خَيْرٌ ۚ اهْبِطُوا مِصْرًا فَإِنَّ لَكُم مَّا سَأَلْتُمْ ۗ وَضُرِبَتْ عَلَيْهِمُ الذِّلَّةُ وَالْمَسْكَنَةُ وَبَاءُوا بِغَضَبٍ مِّنَ اللَّهِ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِأَنَّهُمْ كَانُوا يَكْفُرُونَ بِآيَاتِ اللَّهِ وَيَقْتُلُونَ النَّبِيِّينَ بِغَيْرِ حَقٍّ ۗ ذَٰلِكَ بِمَا عَصَوا وَّكَانُوا يَعْتَدُونَ
English: And [recall] when you said, "O Moses, we can never endure one [kind of] food. So call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the earth its green herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions." [Moses] said, "Would you exchange what is better for what is less? Go into [any] settlement and indeed, you will have what you have asked." And they were covered with humiliation and poverty and returned with anger from Allah [upon them]. That was because they [repeatedly] disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were [habitually] transgressing.

In this context, "أَتَسْتَبْدِلُونَ" (Atastabdiloon) is translated as "Would you exchange", referring to the Israelites' wish to exchange the manna and quails they were provided with for the vegetables of the earth.

### It can write a short khatira

```
User: write a short khaatira on the importance of perseverance

Ansari: Bismillah al-Rahman al-Rahim,

Today, let's reflect on the importance of perseverance, a quality highly valued in Islam.

Perseverance, or Sabr in Arabic, is often translated as patience, but it encompasses much more. It's about resilience, steadfastness, and enduring difficulties while remaining faithful to Allah's commands.

Allah says in the Qur'an in Surah Al-Baqarah (2:153):

Arabic: يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اسْتَعِينُوا بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلَاةِ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ
English: O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.

This verse reminds us that perseverance is not a passive state, but an active one. It's about seeking help through patience and prayer, and knowing that Allah is with us in our struggles.

Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, a great scholar, once said, "Allah has mentioned patience in the Qur'an in 90 places."

Perseverance is the key to overcoming challenges. It's the quality that helps us maintain our faith during times of hardship and uncertainty. It's what allows us to continue doing good, even when it's difficult.

Remember the words of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as recorded in Sahih Bukhari: "The real patience is at the first stroke of a calamity."

So, let's strive to cultivate this quality of perseverance. Let's be patient in our trials, steadfast in our prayers, and resilient in our faith. For indeed, Allah is with the patient.

May Allah grant us all the strength to persevere through our trials and tribulations. Ameen.

Wa Allahu 'Alam (And Allah knows best).

### It can generate Islamized stories

```
User: Write a brief islamized version of the story of the boy who cried wolf.

Ansari: In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,

Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a young boy named Ahmed. Ahmed was responsible for looking after his family's flock of sheep. His father, a wise and pious man, always reminded him of the importance of honesty as taught in our beautiful religion, Islam. He would often quote the Hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) recorded by Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim, "Truthfulness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to Paradise."

However, Ahmed, being a playful and mischievous boy, thought it would be amusing to trick the villagers. One day, he cried out, "Wolf! Wolf!" The villagers, hearing his cries, rushed to help him, only to find out there was no wolf. Ahmed laughed at their confused and annoyed faces.

He repeated this trick a few times, each time causing distress among the villagers. They reminded him of the verse from the Qur'an, Surah Al-Baqarah (2:42), "And do not mix the truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know [it]."

One day, a wolf really did come. Terrified, Ahmed cried out for help, "Wolf! Wolf!" But this time, no one came to his aid. They thought it was another one of his tricks. The wolf attacked the flock, and Ahmed could do nothing but watch in despair.

When his father found out, he reminded Ahmed of the consequences of lying. He quoted a Hadith from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim, "Beware of lying, for lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to Hell."

From that day forward, Ahmed learned his lesson. He understood the wisdom in the teachings of Islam about truthfulness and honesty. He promised never to lie again and grew up to be a truthful and trustworthy man, just as our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was known as Al-Sadiq (the truthful) and Al-Amin (the trustworthy).

And this story serves as a reminder for us all about the importance of honesty and the consequences of lying. May Allah guide us to be among the truthful. Ameen.

### It can generate poetry

```
User: OK now express the above as a poem.

Ansari: 
In a village small and quaint, lived a boy without restraint,
Young Ahmed, shepherd of the flock, against the wolf, he was the block.

His father wise, with faith so deep, told him, "Son, your word you keep,
For truth leads to righteousness, and that to Heaven, no less."

But Ahmed, playful, full of jest, put his villagers to test,
Cried "Wolf! Wolf!" though none was near, laughed at their unfounded fear.

Again he cried, the wolf's attack, but his lies held no fact,
The villagers, with trust now shaken, felt by the boy, they were forsaken.

A verse from the Qur'an they shared, "Mix not truth with falsehood, be not ensnared,
Conceal not truth, while you know," yet Ahmed's antics didn't slow.

Then came the day, the wolf appeared, Ahmed cried out, just as feared,
"Wolf! Wolf!" echoed his plea, but the villagers let it be.

The wolf attacked, the flock was lost, Ahmed now felt the cost,
His father said, "Lying leads to wickedness, and that to Hell's abyss."

Ahmed learned, from that day on, the value of the dawn,
The dawn of truth in one's heart, from which he vowed never to part.

He grew up truthful, trustworthy too, just like the Prophet, our guide so true,
And so we learn, from Ahmed's tale, in truth and honesty, we shall not fail.

May Allah guide us on the path, save us from falsehood's wrath,
Lead us to righteousness, and in the Hereafter, eternal bliss. Ameen.
