Fiqh,Saifeldeen,Single Turn,When does Ramadan begin and end?,"Ramadan, the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar, begins and ends with the sighting of the moon. The start of Ramadan is marked by the sighting of the crescent moon (hilal), signifying the end of the previous month, Sha'ban. Similarly, Ramadan ends with the sighting of the crescent moon that marks the beginning of Shawwal, the month following Ramadan. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: I believe (though not 100% sure of the reference) there is a hadith that says: ""Fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then complete thirty days of Sha'ban. And break your fast when you see the crescent. If it is obscured to you, then fast thirty days."" This hadith emphasizes the importance of moon sighting in determining the beginning and end of Ramadan. However, in modern times, due to differences in moon sighting and the use of astronomical calculations, there can be variations in the start and end dates of Ramadan across different countries and communities.","Should I follow the moon sighting as per the sunnah, or follow the astronomical calculation method? For context, my local masjid follows the calculation method.","The issue of whether to follow moon sighting (rukyah) or astronomical calculations for determining the beginning of Ramadan is a matter of scholarly debate within the Sunni tradition. Both methods have their proponents among respected scholars, and the difference in opinion stems from interpretations of Islamic texts and the application of Islamic legal principles. 1. **Moon Sighting (Rukyah):** This method is based on the hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), which emphasizes physical moon sighting as the criterion for beginning and ending the fasting month of Ramadan. Scholars who advocate for this method include classical scholars such as Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal and Imam Shafiee, who stress adherence to the hadith and the tradition of physical moon sighting. 2. **Astronomical Calculations:** Some contemporary scholars argue that astronomical calculations can be used to determine the Islamic months, including Ramadan, as they provide precise and unified results. Scholars like Yusuf Al Qaradawi and Muhammad Shinqeeti support the use of calculations under the principle of facilitating ease for Muslims and achieving unity among Muslim communities, especially in regions where moon sighting is difficult due to weather conditions or geographical factors. Given that your local masjid follows the calculation method, it is important to consider the concept of unity and cooperation within the Muslim community. Imam Shafiee mentioned the importance of unity and following the community, especially in matters of worship that involve communal participation, like the start of Ramadan and Eid prayers. If you are in a community where the calculation method is followed, participating in unity with your community can be seen as a valid approach, especially if it is endorsed by trusted local scholars. However, it is also important to respect and understand the diversity of opinions within the Islamic tradition on this matter. Engaging in respectful dialogue and seeking knowledge about the different perspectives can enrich your understanding and help maintain harmony within the Muslim community.",Yes,5,Yes,No,No,
Fiqh,Saifeldeen,Single Turn,What actions invalidate the fast?,"Actions that invalidate the fast are well-defined in Islamic jurisprudence, based on the Qur'an, Hadith, and scholarly consensus. Here are the primary actions that invalidate a fast: 1. **Intentional Eating or Drinking:** Consuming any food or drink intentionally during the daylight hours of Ramadan breaks the fast. 2. **Intentional Vomiting:** If someone forces themselves to vomit intentionally, this invalidates the fast. 3. **Sexual Intercourse:** Engaging in sexual intercourse during the daylight hours of Ramadan invalidates the fast. 4. **Menstruation and Postnatal Bleeding:** The onset of menstruation or postnatal bleeding automatically breaks a woman's fast, even if it occurs just before sunset. 5. **Intentional Injection of Nourishing Substances:** Receiving intravenous or intramuscular nourishment intended to replace food and drink invalidates the fast. 6. **Smoking:** Smoking anything during the daylight hours of Ramadan breaks the fast. It's important to note that if any of these actions are done forgetfully, under compulsion, or due to a mistake, the fast is not invalidated. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: I believe (though not 100% sure of the reference) there is a hadith that says: ""If someone forgets while fasting and eats or drinks, then he should complete his fast, for it is Allah who has fed him and given him drink."" This hadith emphasizes Allah's mercy and understanding of human forgetfulness or error. If one unintentionally breaks the fast, they should simply continue fasting for the rest of the day and do not need to make up for it. Regarding the hadiths provided: - The first hadith from Abu Dawud emphasizes the practice of hastening to break the fast after sunset, which is a recommended action but not related to actions that invalidate the fast. - The second and third hadiths from Ibn Majah and An-Nasa'i highlight that fasting while traveling is not considered an act of righteousness if it causes hardship, indicating the allowance for breaking the fast while traveling. However, this also does not directly address actions that invalidate the fast. Always, when in doubt about specific situations or actions, it's advisable to consult with knowledgeable scholars or authorities in your community",,,Yes,5,Yes,No,No,Ansari really loves quoting Qaradawi!
Fiqh,Saifeldeen,Single Turn,What is the ruling on using medications during fasting?,"The use of medications during fasting in Ramadan is a matter that Islamic scholars have addressed with consideration to the principles of Islamic jurisprudence and the preservation of health. The ruling on using medications while fasting depends on the method of administration and the condition of the individual: 1. **Oral Medications:** Taking medication orally (by mouth) that reaches the stomach breaks the fast. If a fasting person needs to take oral medication during the day for a health condition, they should make up the fast later. 2. **Non-Nutritive Injections:** Injections that are not nutritive (do not serve as nourishment and do not substitute for food or drink), such as insulin for diabetics or vaccines, do not break the fast according to many contemporary scholars, including Yusuf Al Qaradawi and the Islamic Fiqh Academy. The reasoning is that these injections do not reach the stomach through the usual channels (mouth or nose). 3. **Intravenous (IV) Medications:** If the IV medication is purely medicinal and not intended as nourishment, many scholars consider that it does not break the fast. However, if the IV solution is nutritive (intended to replace food and drink), it breaks the fast. 4. **Inhalers:** Scholars have differing opinions on inhalers used by asthmatics. Some scholars, including Yusuf Al Qaradawi, allow the use of inhalers, arguing that the particles are so fine that they do not have the same ruling as food or drink. Others consider it to break the fast, recommending that individuals who need to use inhalers during the day should make up the fast later. 5. **Eye Drops, Ear Drops, and Nasal Sprays:** The majority of scholars agree that eye and ear drops do not break the fast as they do not reach the stomach. However, there is more caution with nasal sprays due to the closer connection to the throat and the possibility of reaching the stomach. Some scholars advise avoiding nasal sprays that reach the throat while fasting, if possible. It's important for Muslims to consider their health condition and the necessity of medication during the fasting hours. If taking medication is essential for maintaining health, Islam provides concessions for individuals to break their fast and make it up later. The principle of not causing harm to oneself is paramount in Islamic jurisprudence. For specific medical conditions and treatments, it's advisable to consult with knowledgeable Islamic scholars and healthcare professionals to make informed decisions that align with both Islamic guidelines and health needs.",,,Yes,5,No,No,No,
Fiqh,Saifeldeen,Single Turn,Can pregnant or breastfeeding women fast?,"Pregnant and breastfeeding women are given special consideration in Islamic jurisprudence regarding fasting, especially during Ramadan. The primary concern is the health and well-being of both the mother and the child. 1. **If Fasting Poses No Harm:** If a pregnant or breastfeeding woman is healthy and has been advised that fasting poses no risk to her health or her baby's health, she can fast. 2. **If Fasting Poses Harm:** If fasting is deemed harmful or poses a risk to the health of the mother or the child, she is allowed, and even encouraged, to break her fast. This is based on the Islamic principle of removing harm and hardship. Scholars including Yusuf Al Qaradawi and the Islamic Fiqh Academy have stated that pregnant and breastfeeding women who fear harm to themselves or their babies have the option not to fast during Ramadan. They are required to make up the missed fasts at a later time when they are able to do so without risk. Additionally, there is an option for fidya (compensation) in some interpretations, where if the woman is unable to make up the fasts before the next Ramadan due to continuous pregnancy, breastfeeding, or health concerns, she may feed a poor person for each day missed. This is based on the understanding of certain hadiths and the application of Islamic legal principles aimed at easing hardship. It's important for pregnant and breastfeeding women to consult with medical professionals and knowledgeable Islamic scholars to make informed decisions about fasting. The health and well-being of the mother and child are paramount, and Islam provides concessions to ensure they are not put at risk.",,,Yes,0,Not set,No,No,
Fiqh,Saifeldeen,Single Turn,How to make up missed fasts?,"Making up missed fasts (Qada') from Ramadan is an important duty for Muslims who were unable to fast due to valid reasons such as illness, travel, menstruation, pregnancy, or breastfeeding. Here's how to make up missed fasts according to Islamic jurisprudence: 1. **Intention (Niyyah):** Like the fasts of Ramadan, making up missed fasts requires the intention to fast for the sake of Allah. The intention should be made in the heart before Fajr (dawn) of the day you plan to fast. 2. **Timing:** Missed fasts can be made up on any day of the year except on days when fasting is prohibited, such as the day of Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, and the three days following Eid al-Adha (the days of Tashreeq). There is no specific order or immediate requirement to make up the fasts, but it is recommended to do so before the next Ramadan arrives. 3. **Consecutive or Non-Consecutive:** Missed fasts can be made up consecutively or non-consecutively. You have the flexibility to choose the days that are most convenient for you, taking into account your health and personal circumstances. 4. **Fidya (Compensation):** In cases where an individual is unable to fast due to a chronic illness or old age, and there is no hope of recovery, they may pay fidya, which is feeding a poor person for each day missed. The amount of fidya is equivalent to the cost of feeding one poor person two meals for a day or half a sa' (approximately 1.5 to 2 kilograms) of staple foodstuff like wheat, rice, etc., per day missed. 5. **Seeking Medical and Scholarly Advice:** If you are unsure whether you are fit to fast or if making up the fasts would be harmful to your health, consult a medical professional. Additionally, for specific questions about your situation, it's advisable to consult with knowledgeable Islamic scholars. 6. **Making Up for Other Acts of Worship:** If the missed fasts were accompanied by missed prayers, it is important to make a sincere repentance for the missed prayers, as the prayers cannot be made up in the same way as fasts. However, doing good deeds and voluntary prayers can help compensate for the shortcomings. It's important to approach the making up of missed fasts with sincerity and the intention to fulfill this obligation for the sake of Allah. While making up missed fasts, continue to seek Allah's forgiveness and mercy, and strive to maintain a strong connection with Him through regular prayers, charity, and good deeds.",,,Yes,5,No,No,No,"I asked this question a few times on different occassions.

Fiqh,Saifeldeen,Multi Turn,What is the ruling on using inhalers or other medical devices?,"The use of inhalers or other medical devices during fasting in Ramadan is a matter that has been discussed by contemporary scholars, given the importance of accommodating health needs within the framework of Islamic law. Scholars like Yusuf Al Qaradawi have addressed the issue of using inhalers during fasting. According to Al Qaradawi, using an inhaler does not break the fast because the substance inhaled is a gas and does not reach the stomach as food or drink would. This view is based on the principle that acts which do not involve the intake of nourishment or medicine through conventional means (mouth to stomach) do not invalidate the fast. Similarly, the use of other medical devices that do not introduce nourishment or medicine to the stomach, and are necessary for maintaining health, are generally considered permissible by scholars during fasting. This is in line with the Islamic principle of making concessions and easing difficulties, especially in matters of health and necessity. It is always recommended for individuals with specific medical conditions requiring the use of such devices to consult with knowledgeable Islamic scholars and medical professionals to ensure that their practices are in accordance with both their health needs and Islamic law.",,,Yes,5,Yes,No,No,
Fiqh,Saifeldeen,Multi Turn,Can a person continue fasting if they experience menstruation during Ramadan?,"When a woman experiences menstruation during Ramadan, she is required to break her fast. This ruling is based on the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, and is agreed upon by classical scholars across the major Islamic schools of thought. Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik, Imam Shafiee, and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, the founders of the four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence, all concur that menstruation is among the valid reasons for breaking the fast during Ramadan. The basis for this ruling is the understanding that menstruation is a natural condition that can cause weakness and discomfort, and Islam seeks to alleviate hardship and not impose undue burden on its followers. After the period of menstruation is over, a woman is required to make up for the days of fasting missed during Ramadan at a later time, before the next Ramadan if possible. This is in accordance with the principle of qada (making up missed acts of worship), which ensures that the obligation of fasting is fulfilled while also accommodating the natural and health-related needs of women. It's important for Muslim women to be aware of these rulings so they can practice their faith in a manner that is both in accordance with Islamic law and respectful of their health and well-being.",Isn't a woman required to fast her make up days before the next ramadan?,"In Islamic jurisprudence, it is recommended for a woman to make up her missed fasts due to menstruation before the arrival of the next Ramadan. However, there is flexibility in this matter. Classical scholars, including Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik, Imam Shafiee, and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, have discussed the issue of making up missed fasts. The consensus is that while it is preferable to make up missed fasts as soon as possible, there is no explicit sin if one delays making up these fasts until after the next Ramadan arrives, as long as they are made up eventually. This is based on the understanding that circumstances such as continuous illness, menstruation, or other valid reasons might prevent someone from fasting. However, if the delay is without a valid reason until another Ramadan comes, some scholars, including Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, have mentioned that it is obligatory to feed a poor person for each day missed in addition to making up the fast, as a form of expiation for the delay. This view emphasizes the importance of fulfilling one's obligations in a timely manner. It's important for individuals to strive to make up missed fasts before the next Ramadan if possible, but also to understand that Islam provides allowances for genuine difficulties and circumstances. Consulting with knowledgeable scholars can provide guidance tailored to individual situations.",Yes,4,No,No,No,"I was surprised that no references were provided here, i.e. no hadith - I believe there is a sound hadith of Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri which states this."
Fiqh,Saifeldeen,Generative,What foul language should be avoided during fasting? can you give me examples?,"During fasting, it's essential to maintain a high level of conduct, which includes avoiding all forms of foul language and behavior that contradicts the spirit of fasting. Fasting in Islam is not just about abstaining from food and drink but also about purifying one's speech and actions. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, emphasized the importance of good conduct during fasting in several hadiths. Examples of foul language to avoid during fasting (and indeed at all times) include: 1. **Swearing and Cursing:** Using offensive words or phrases that insult or demean others. 2. **Backbiting and Slander:** Speaking ill of someone in their absence or spreading false information about them. 3. **Lying:** Deliberately telling untruths. 4. **Gossiping:** Engaging in idle talk about others, especially about their private affairs. 5. **Obscene Language:** Using vulgar or sexually explicit language. The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, provided guidance on this matter, as reported in a hadith: I believe (though not 100% sure of the reference) there is a hadith that says: ""If one does not eschew lies and false conduct, Allah has no need that he should abstain from his food and his drink.""",I want to avoid profanities but I am unsure of which words would be profane.

Spirituality & Virtues,Waleed,Single Turn,Why does Allah make us fast? ,"Allah has prescribed fasting for the believers as a means of attaining taqwa (piety and consciousness of Allah). The purpose of fasting is clearly mentioned in the Qur'an: Ayah: 2:183 Arabic: يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ English: O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous. This verse from Surah Al-Baqarah indicates that fasting is ordained to help believers develop self-restraint and God-consciousness. By abstaining from lawful things like food, drink, and marital relations from dawn until sunset, a Muslim learns to control their desires, which can help them avoid unlawful actions as well. Additionally, fasting serves as a reminder of the blessings Allah has provided, and it fosters empathy for those who are less fortunate and who experience hunger on a regular basis. It is a time for spiritual reflection, increased devotion, and worship. The month of Ramadan, in which fasting is observed, is also the month in which the Qur'an was revealed, providing guidance for humanity. Fasting during this month is a way to commemorate the revelation and to seek closeness to Allah through extra prayers, recitation of the Qur'an, and other acts of worship. Ayah: 2:185 Arabic: شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِنَ الْهُدَى وَالْفُرْقَانِ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ الشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَى سَفَرٍ فَعِدَّةٌ مِنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ يُرِيدُ اللَّهُ بِكُمُ الْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ الْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا الْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا اللَّهَ عَلَى مَا هَدَاكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ English: The month of Ramadan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights [the new moon of] the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [wants] for you to complete the period and to glorify Allah for that [to] which He has guided you, and perhaps you will be grateful. Through fasting, Muslims also learn discipline, self-control, sacrifice, and compassion for those who are less fortunate, thus fostering a sense of community and solidarity among the ummah (global Muslim community).",,,Yes,5,Yes,No,No,A little too verbose maybe? 
Spirituality & Virtues,Waleed,Single Turn,How does fasting improve taqwa? ,"Fasting is considered a means to cultivate taqwa, which is often translated as ""God-consciousness"" or ""piety."" The connection between fasting and taqwa is explicitly mentioned in the Qur'an: Ayah: 2:183 Arabic: يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ English: O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous (taqwa). Fasting improves taqwa in several ways: 1. **Obedience to Divine Command**: By fasting, a person is following a command from Allah, which is a direct act of worship and obedience. This obedience enhances one's awareness of Allah's presence and commands. 2. **Self-Restraint**: Fasting requires abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs during daylight hours, which teaches self-discipline and control over desires. This restraint is a practical exercise in controlling one's behavior for the sake of Allah, which is a key aspect of taqwa. 3. **Empathy and Compassion**: Experiencing hunger and thirst can lead to greater empathy for those who are less fortunate and who face these conditions regularly. This empathy can motivate a person to engage in acts of charity and kindness, which are also forms of taqwa. 4. **Reflection and Mindfulness**: The state of fasting encourages reflection on one's life and actions. It provides an opportunity to be more mindful of one's duties to Allah and to others, leading to a more conscious effort to avoid sin and to do good. 5. **Spiritual Focus**: Fasting helps to minimize distractions and allows for a greater focus on prayer, recitation of the Qur'an, and other acts of worship. This spiritual focus helps to build a closer connection with Allah, which is at the heart of taqwa. Classical scholars like Imam Ghazali and Ibn Al Qayyim have discussed the spiritual benefits of fasting and its role in purifying the soul and developing taqwa. They emphasize that fasting is not merely abstaining from food and drink but also from sinful behavior and speech, which aligns with the broader objectives of taqwa. Modern scholars such as Yusuf Al Qaradawi and Omar Suleiman also highlight the importance of fasting in developing taqwa, noting that it is a comprehensive form of worship that affects the heart, the soul, and the body, leading to a holistic improvement in one's relationship with Allah.",,"However, I can offer guidance on how to recognize and avoid profanity.

Spirituality & Virtues,Waleed,Single Turn,What makes laylatul qadr so important? ,"Laylatul Qadr, also known as the Night of Decree or the Night of Power, is considered the holiest night in the Islamic calendar. It is important for several reasons: 1. Revelation of the Qur'an: Laylatul Qadr is traditionally celebrated as the night when the first verses of the Qur'an were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). This event marks the beginning of the revelation of the Qur'an, which continued over 23 years. 2. Better than a thousand months: The Qur'an states that worship and good deeds performed on this night are better than those performed over a thousand months. This amplifies the spiritual rewards and significance of acts of worship during this night. Ayah: 97:3 Arabic: لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ English: The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. 3. Decree of destiny: It is believed that on this night, Allah decrees the destiny of all creation for the coming year. Muslims seek forgiveness, mercy, and blessings for themselves and others during this night. 4. Peace until dawn: The Qur'an describes Laylatul Qadr as a night of peace until the emergence of dawn, indicating a special tranquility and spiritual presence. Ayah: 97:5 Arabic: سَلَامٌ هِيَ حَتَّىٰ مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ English: Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.

This connection is further emphasized by the practice of Taraweeh prayers, where Muslims gather to pray extra prayers at night and listen to the recitation of the Qur'an. It is a tradition to attempt to complete the recitation of the entire Qur'an during these prayers over the course of the month. Moreover, the act of reciting the Qur'an during Ramadan is considered especially virtuous. Muslims are encouraged to read and reflect upon the Qur'an more intensively during this month, seeking to deepen their understanding and connection with the divine guidance it contains.

Spirituality & Virtues,Waleed,Single Turn,What is the best dua to make during Ramadan? ,"During Ramadan, one of the most recommended supplications to make is the one seeking forgiveness and mercy from Allah. A highly recommended dua, especially during the last ten nights of Ramadan, is:

اللَّهُمَّ إِنَّكَ عَفُوٌّ تُحِبُّ الْعَفْوَ فَاعْفُ عَنِّي

Translation: ""O Allah, You are Forgiving and love forgiveness, so forgive me.""

This dua was taught by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) when she asked about what to say during Laylatul Qadr (the Night of Decree), which is believed to fall within the last ten nights of Ramadan. This supplication encapsulates the essence of seeking Allah's forgiveness, mercy, and benevolence.

Remember, the best dua is that which comes from the heart, reflecting sincerity, humility, and a deep personal connection with Allah. During Ramadan, it is also encouraged to make dua for your personal needs, the well-being of your family, the Muslim Ummah, and humanity at large.

Spirituality & Virtues,Waleed,Multi Turn,"While fasting, I get so hungry I can't focus in prayer. What should I do? ","Feeling hunger while fasting is a natural part of the experience, and it can indeed make it challenging to focus during prayer. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) acknowledged the difficulties and sacrifices involved in fasting, but also emphasized its spiritual benefits. Although the hadiths I found are graded as weak and thus may not be strong evidence, they do reflect the general Islamic principle that fasting is a shield and has a high reward. In such situations, it is recommended to remember the purpose of fasting, which is to attain taqwa (God-consciousness) as mentioned in the Qur'an: Ayah: 2:183 Arabic: يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ [Current language]: O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous. To help with concentration in prayer, you might consider the following practical steps: 1. Ensure you have suhoor (pre-dawn meal) with foods that release energy slowly, such as complex carbohydrates and protein, to help sustain you through the day. 2. Stay hydrated during non-fasting hours by drinking plenty of water. 3. Take short naps if possible to help with fatigue. 4. Engage in dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and make dua (supplication) asking for strength and focus. 5. Try to minimize physical exertion during the day to conserve energy for prayer times. Remember that Allah is aware of your efforts and struggles, and even the discomfort you feel while fasting is recognized and will be rewarded, insha'Allah (God willing). If the hunger is causing extreme difficulty or health issues, consult with a knowledgeable person or a scholar to discuss your situation, as Islam does not intend to impose hardship beyond one's capacity.","If prayer is more important than fasting, shouldn't I break my fast?","1. **Mindfulness:** Be conscious of your language, especially in moments of strong emotion.

Spirituality & Virtues,Waleed,Multi Turn,I'm too tired to make both tahajjud and tarawih in Ramadan. What would you suggest I do? ,"In Ramadan, both Tahajjud and Tarawih prayers hold great significance and offer immense rewards. However, it's important to balance religious obligations with one's physical capabilities. Tarawih is a special prayer performed during the nights of Ramadan, and it is highly recommended (Sunnah Mu'akkadah) according to the majority of scholars, including Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Malik, Imam Shafiee, and Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal. It is performed in congregation after the Isha prayer. The Prophet Muhammad said: ""Whoever stands (in the voluntary night prayer of) Ramadan out of faith and in hope of reward, his previous sins will be forgiven."" (I believe, though not 100% sure of the reference). Tahajjud, on the other hand, is a voluntary prayer performed late at night, and it can be prayed until just before the Fajr prayer. It is a time when prayers are more likely to be accepted, as mentioned in the Qur'an (17:79) and through various hadiths. If you find it difficult to perform both due to tiredness, consider the following suggestions: 1. **Prioritize Tarawih**: Since Tarawih is specific to Ramadan and is performed in congregation, it fosters a sense of community and maximizes the Ramadan experience. If you have to choose, prioritizing Tarawih might be more beneficial in capturing the Ramadan spirit. 2. **Perform Shorter Tahajjud**: If you still wish to perform Tahajjud, it doesn't have to be long. Even two rak'ahs with heartfelt supplication can be significant. The Prophet Muhammad said: ""The night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on, and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn (Fajr prayer) he should pray one Rak'ah and this will be a Witr for all the Rakat which he has prayed before."" (I believe, though not 100% sure of the reference). 3. **Quality Over Quantity**: Focus on the quality of your prayer rather than the quantity. A few rak'ahs prayed with concentration and devotion are better than many rak'ahs prayed hastily. 4. **Seek Ease**: Islam encourages ease and does not want hardship for its followers. Allah says in the Qur'an: ""Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship"" (2:185). Remember, the most important thing is your sincere intention and effort to worship Allah during this blessed month.

One of the greatest treasures hidden within these days is Laylat al-Qadr, the Night of Decree, about which Allah says in the Qur'an: Ayah: 97:3 Arabic: لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ Translation: The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. This night is a gift of immense magnitude, a night in which the Qur'an was revealed. Engaging in worship during this night is equivalent to worshiping for more than 83 years. It is a night that encapsulates mercy, forgiveness, and salvation from the Hellfire. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal emphasized the importance of striving in worship during these last ten days. He would dedicate himself to worship, seeking to catch Laylat al-Qadr, understanding its value and the immense reward that comes with it. Let us follow in the footsteps of our pious predecessors. Let us increase our acts of worship, our recitation of the Qur'an, our supplications, and our charity. Let us seek forgiveness with sincere hearts, hoping for Allah's mercy and fearing His punishment. Remember, these days are an opportunity that does not come often. They are a chance to have our sins forgiven, to have our supplications answered, and to be freed from the Hellfire. Let us not be of those who look back with regret for not having taken full advantage of this blessed time. Let us rally together, motivate one another, and support each other in maximizing these precious days. Let us be generous, not just with our wealth, but with our time, our knowledge, and our kindness. May Allah accept our fasting, our prayers, our charity, and all our acts of worship. May He grant us the strength to worship Him as He deserves to be worshiped. May He make us among those who catch Laylat al-Qadr and reap its immense rewards.

These verses instruct believing women to draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except what is apparent, and to extend their garments to cover themselves for the sake of modesty.

","The Qur'an does not explicitly mention that kissing one's wife breaks the fast. However, it provides general guidelines on what is permissible during the nights of Ramadan, which includes being intimate with one's spouse. Ayah 2:187 clarifies this:

Arabic: أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ ٱلصِّيَامِ ٱلرَّفَثُ إِلَىٰ نِسَآئِكُمْ ۚ هُنَّ لِبَاسٌ لَّكُمْ وَأَنتُمْ لِبَاسٌ لَّهُنَّ ۗ عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتَانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنكُمْ ۖ فَٱلْـَٔـٰنَ بَـٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَٱبْتَغُوا مَا كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ لَكُمْ ۚ وَكُلُوا وَٱشْرَبُوا حَتَّىٰ يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ ٱلْخَيْطُ ٱلْأَبْيَضُ مِنَ ٱلْخَيْطِ ٱلْأَسْوَدِ مِنَ ٱلْفَجْرِ ۖ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا ٱلصِّيَامَ إِلَى ٱلَّيْلِ ۚ وَلَا تُبَـٰشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنتُمْ عَـٰكِفُونَ فِى ٱلْمَسَـٰجِدِ ۗ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ ٱللَّهِ فَلَا تَقْرَبُوهَا ۗ كَذَٰلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ ٱللَّهُ ءَايَـٰتِهِۦ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ

Translation: It has been made permissible for you to be intimate with your wives during the nights preceding the fast. Your spouses are a garment for you as you are for them. Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves. So He has accepted your repentance and pardoned you. So now you may be intimate with them and seek what Allah has prescribed for you. ˹You may˺ eat and drink until you see the light of dawn breaking the darkness of night, then complete the fast until nightfall. Do not be intimate with your spouses while you are meditating in the mosques. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not exceed them. This is how Allah makes His revelations clear to people, so they may become mindful ˹of Him˺.

This verse indicates that intimacy is allowed during the night until the pre-dawn meal. However, during the day, while fasting, such acts are to be avoided to maintain the sanctity of the fast. Scholars have discussed acts that may lead to breaking the fast, and it's generally advised to avoid actions that could lead to arousal or ejaculation, as these can invalidate the fast. For specific rulings, it's best to consult with a knowledgeable scholar who can provide guidance based on the Qur'an and Sunnah.","are you sure about that. I thought surah nisa said no kissing

Qur'an,Iman,Single Turn,"loving idols more than allah
","Loving anything or anyone more than Allah is a matter that Islam takes very seriously. The Qur'an addresses this issue directly, emphasizing the importance of loving Allah above all else and warning against taking others as equals to Allah.

Ayah 2:165 highlights this concern explicitly:
Arabic: وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَتَّخِذُ مِن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ أَندَادًا يُحِبُّونَهُمْ كَحُبِّ ٱللَّهِ ۖ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوٓا أَشَدُّ حُبًّا لِّلَّهِ ۗ وَلَوْ يَرَى ٱلَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوٓا إِذْ يَرَوْنَ ٱلْعَذَابَ أَنَّ ٱلْقُوَّةَ لِلَّهِ جَمِيعًا وَأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ شَدِيدُ ٱلْعَذَابِ
Translation: Still there are some who take others as Allah’s equal—they love them as they should love Allah—but the ˹true˺ believers love Allah even more. If only the wrongdoers could see the ˹horrible˺ punishment ˹awaiting them˺, they would certainly realize that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is indeed severe in punishment.

This verse clearly states that there are people who love others as they should love Allah, which is a grave mistake. True believers, however, love Allah more intensely. This love for Allah is not just a matter of emotion but is also reflected in obedience, submission, and following the guidance provided by Allah and His Messenger.

Ayah 3:31 further emphasizes the importance of following the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a sign of love for Allah:
Arabic: قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ ٱللَّهَ فَٱتَّبِعُونِى يُحِبِّبْكُمُ ٱللَّهُ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ
Translation: Say, ˹O Prophet,˺ “If you ˹sincerely˺ love Allah, then follow me; Allah will love you and forgive your sins. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful.”

Loving Allah above all else is foundational to faith in Islam. It requires prioritizing Allah's commands and guidance above personal desires or societal pressures.

Qur'an,Iman,Single Turn,"sometimes I feel down about my sins and feel that Allah won't forgive me 
","Feeling down about one's sins is a natural human emotion, reflecting a conscience and a desire for repentance. It's important to remember that Allah's mercy and forgiveness are vast and encompassing. The Qur'an is replete with verses that emphasize Allah's forgiveness and mercy towards those who sincerely repent and seek His forgiveness.

1. **Allah's Forgiveness and Mercy**: ""And seek Allah’s forgiveness—indeed, Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful."" (Ayah: 4:106)

2. **Encouragement to Seek Forgiveness**: ""Then go forth with the rest of the pilgrims. And seek Allah’s forgiveness. Surely Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful."" (Ayah: 2:199)

3. **Reward for Patience and Good Deeds**: ""Except those who patiently endure and do good. It is they who will have forgiveness and a mighty reward."" (Ayah: 11:11)

4. **Allah's Mercy is Boundless**: ""Whoever commits evil or wrongs themselves then seeks Allah’s forgiveness will certainly find Allah All-Forgiving, Most Merciful."" (Ayah: 4:110)

5. **Transformation of Sins into Good Deeds**: ""As for those who repent, believe, and do good deeds, they are the ones whose evil deeds Allah will change into good deeds. For Allah is All-Forgiving, Most Merciful."" (Ayah: 25:70)

However, it's also crucial to be aware that there are conditions where forgiveness is not granted, specifically for those who die in disbelief and have hindered others from the path of Allah without seeking repentance (Ayah: 4:168, 47:34).

The essence of these verses is to encourage believers to always turn back to Allah, no matter the magnitude of their sins, with sincere repentance and a commitment to do good.

Qur'an,Iman,Multi Turn,"should I change my job if I cannot pray at work?
","The ability to perform Salah (prayer) is a fundamental aspect of a Muslim's faith and daily routine. Islam places great emphasis on the observance of the five daily prayers as a pivotal act of worship. The importance of Salah is highlighted in the Qur'an and Hadith, and it is considered one of the pillars of Islam.

Regarding your situation, it's important to consider the advice of scholars on the matter. While I cannot provide a direct answer specific to your circumstances, I can share general guidance from Islamic teachings and scholars.

Yusuf Al Qaradawi, a respected contemporary scholar, emphasizes the importance of Muslims being able to perform their prayers within their work environment. He suggests that Muslims should seek to negotiate with their employers to find a way to perform their prayers, highlighting the possibility of flexibility in the timing of breaks to accommodate prayer times.

Ibn Taymiyyah, a classical scholar, also stressed the significance of Salah, stating that it is obligatory upon every Muslim to perform the five daily prayers within their prescribed times. He advised Muslims to ensure that their work or other activities do not prevent them from fulfilling this essential act of worship.

If you find yourself in a situation where you cannot perform your prayers at work, it may be worthwhile to:
1. Discuss with your employer the possibility of adjusting break times to allow for prayer. Many employers are willing to accommodate such requests.
2. Look for a nearby mosque or a quiet place where you can perform your prayers during breaks.
3. If the above options are not feasible, you might consider seeking employment that allows you to fulfill your religious obligations. However, this step should be considered carefully, taking into account your personal circumstances, financial stability, and the availability of alternative employment opportunities.

It's important to make a decision based on a thorough assessment of your situation, seeking guidance through prayer (Istikhara) and consulting with knowledgeable individuals or scholars if possible.

Remember, Allah knows your intentions and the efforts you make to fulfill your religious duties. May Allah make it easy for you to find a solution that allows you to maintain your prayers and provide for your needs.",well what does the quran say?,"The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of Salah (prayer) in several verses, highlighting its significance as a fundamental act of worship for Muslims.

     Translation: Observe the prayer from the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and the dawn prayer, for certainly the dawn prayer is witnessed ˹by angels˺.

3. **Duty of Prayer**:

     Translation: When the prayers are over, remember Allah—whether you are standing, sitting, or lying down. But when you are secure, establish regular prayers. Indeed, performing prayers is a duty on the believers at the appointed times.

4. **Friday Prayer**:

These verses underscore the importance of maintaining the five daily prayers, observing them at their prescribed times, and prioritizing them over worldly matters.

Ibn Taymiyyah, a respected classical scholar, emphasized the importance of patience and perseverance in the face of difficulties in practicing one's faith. He taught that trials and tribulations are a test from Allah, and facing them with patience can lead to spiritual growth and increased faith.

Modern scholars like Yasir Qadhi and Omar Suleiman often speak about the importance of understanding the spirit of the law in Islam, rather than just the letter. They encourage Muslims to seek knowledge, ask for guidance, and strive for a balanced approach in practicing their faith.

If you're finding specific rules difficult to follow, it might be helpful to learn more about the wisdom and reasons behind them. Seeking knowledge can make it easier to understand and implement Islamic teachings in your life. Remember, Allah appreciates every effort you make towards obeying Him, no matter how small. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:

1. **Open Dialogue**: Initiate a calm and respectful conversation with your husband about your desire to wear the hijab. Share your feelings and the religious reasoning behind your decision. It's possible that he may have concerns or misunderstandings that can be addressed through discussion.

2. **Seek Knowledge Together**: Propose to learn together about the importance of hijab in Islam. You can refer to the Qur'an, Hadith, and the opinions of respected scholars. Understanding the religious basis might help in appreciating the significance of hijab.

Allah, the Exalted, says in the Qur'an:

Ayah: 38:29
Arabic: كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ وَلِيَتَذَكَّرَ أُولُو الْأَلْبَابِ
Translation: [This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that they might reflect upon its verses and that those of understanding would be reminded.

This verse beautifully encapsulates the essence of why we, as Muslims, should immerse ourselves in the Qur'an. It is not merely a book to be read, but a divine scripture to be pondered upon, a source of endless blessings and a means to awaken our hearts and minds.

The Qur'an is a guide that leads us through the complexities of life, offering solace in times of distress, wisdom in times of confusion, and inspiration in times of need. It is a conversation with Allah, where He speaks to us directly, addressing our deepest concerns, hopes, and fears.

Imam Ibn Al Qayyim, a renowned classical scholar, emphasized the transformative power of the Qur'an on the soul, stating that it purifies the heart, enlightens the mind, and brings tranquility to the spirit. He highlighted that engaging with the Qur'an through thoughtful recitation, reflection, and application is the key to unlocking its treasures.

Moreover, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) exemplified the profound impact of the Qur'an in his life. His character was a living embodiment of the Qur'an, and he encouraged his companions to recite it regularly, reflect on its meanings, and implement its teachings.

In a hadith, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:

I believe (though not 100% sure of the reference) there is a hadith that says: ""The best of you are those who learn the Qur'an and teach it.""

This hadith inspires us to not only engage with the Qur'an personally but also to share its wisdom with others, spreading its light and guidance far and wide.

Let us, therefore, make a sincere intention to connect with the Qur'an daily, even if it is just a few verses. Let us reflect on its meanings, apply its teachings in our lives, and strive to be among those who are best in the sight of Allah, by learning the Qur'an and teaching it to others.

May Allah make us among those who are deeply connected with the Qur'an, who find in it their comfort, guidance, and inspiration. May He make it a proof for us, not against us, on the Day of Judgment. Ameen.",,,Yes,4,Yes,No,No,was hoping for more Quranic references
Seerah / History,Wael,Single Turn,Why do we fast in Ramadan?,"We fast in Ramadan for several reasons, as highlighted in the Qur'an: 1. **Revelation of the Qur'an**: Ramadan is the month in which the Qur'an was revealed as a guide for humanity, with clear proofs of guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). Therefore, fasting this month is a way to honor the revelation of the Qur'an. - Ayah: 2:185 - Arabic: شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَـٰتٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ - Translation: Ramadan is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard to distinguish between right and wrong. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. 2. **Prescribed Duty**: Fasting is prescribed for Muslims as it was for those before them. It is a duty that believers are expected to fulfill. - Ayah: 2:183 - Arabic: يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَى ٱلَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ - Translation: O believers! Fasting is prescribed for you—as it was for those before you—so perhaps you will become mindful of Allah. 3. **Spiritual Benefits**: Fasting is a means to attain taqwa (mindfulness of Allah), which is a central goal in Islam. It helps believers develop self-discipline, self-control, sacrifice, and empathy for those who are less fortunate. - Ayah: 2:183 - Arabic: لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ - Translation: So perhaps you will become mindful of Allah. 4. **Flexibility and Ease**: Allah intends ease for the believers and does not want to place undue hardship on them. Therefore, concessions are made for those who are ill or on a journey, allowing them to make up missed fasts on other days. - Ayah: 2:185 - Arabic: يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلْعُسْرَ - Translation: Allah intends ease for you, not hardship. 5. **Gratitude and Celebration**: Fasting is also a means to express gratitude to Allah for His guidance and blessings. It culminates in the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, a festive day of gratitude and joy. - Ayah: 2:185 - Arabic: وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ - Translation: And perhaps you will be grateful. These verses from the Qur'an provide a comprehensive understanding of why Muslims fast during Ramadan, highlighting its significance as an act of worship, devotion, and gratitude towards Allah.",,,Yes,5,Yes,No,No,
Seerah / History,Wael,Single Turn,I am not sure I understand how the Quran was revealed in Ramadan. I heard it is revealed over 23 years or so. Can you explain?,"The revelation of the Qur'an during Ramadan and its span over approximately 23 years can be understood through two key concepts: the initial revelation and the gradual revelation.

1. **Initial Revelation in Ramadan**: The Qur'an was first revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) during the month of Ramadan. This is mentioned in the Qur'an:

    Ayah: 2:185
    Arabic: شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ
    Translation: The month of Ramadan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an.

    This verse indicates that the revelation of the Qur'an began in Ramadan, marking the commencement of its revelation to humanity.

2. **Gradual Revelation Over 23 Years**: After the initial revelation, the Qur'an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) gradually over a period of approximately 23 years. This gradual revelation allowed for the Qur'an to be revealed in parts, addressing specific situations, guiding the early Muslim community, and providing a practical framework for the implementation of its teachings.

    The wisdom behind the gradual revelation includes facilitating ease in memorization, providing guidance in response to specific events or questions, and allowing for the gradual implementation of Islamic laws and principles.

In summary, the revelation of the Qur'an began in the month of Ramadan with the first revelation to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and it continued to be revealed in parts over approximately 23 years to guide, educate, and nurture the early Muslim community.

Seerah / History,Wael,Single Turn,Is there any non-political major event that happened in Ramadan?,"Yes, there are significant non-political events that occurred during Ramadan, which have deeply spiritual and religious implications. One such event is related to the Tarawih prayers, a practice that holds a special place in Ramadan's observance. **Institution of Tarawih Prayers**: The Tarawih prayers are extra prayers performed by Muslims at night in the month of Ramadan. The origin of these prayers during Ramadan can be traced back to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). According to a hadith: Collection: Abu Dawud LK id: 3_6_469_1239 Narrated 'Aishah, wife of Prophet (ﷺ): That the Prophet (ﷺ) once offered (tarawih) prayer in the mosque and the people also prayed along with him. He then prayed on the following night, and the people gathered in large numbers. They gathered on the third night too, but the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) did not come out to them. When the morning came, he said: I witnessed what you did, and nothing prevented me from coming out to you except that I feared that this (prayer) might be prescribed to you. That was in Ramadan. Grade: Sahih - Authentic This event highlights the Prophet's concern for his Ummah (community) and his desire not to overburden them. It also marks the beginning of the practice of Tarawih prayers during Ramadan, which are highly recommended and widely observed by Muslims around the world as a means of seeking closeness to Allah and the Qur'an during this blessed month. The Tarawih prayers, although not obligatory, have become a cherished part of Ramadan's nightly observances, reflecting the community's devotion and spiritual reflection.",Anything else?,"Another significant non-political event that occurred during Ramadan, deeply rooted in spirituality and religious practice, is related to the concept of **I'tikaf**. **Observance of I'tikaf**: I'tikaf refers to a period of retreat in the mosque for the purpose of worship and reflection, especially during the last ten days of Ramadan. This practice is aimed at seeking Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree), which is better than a thousand months as mentioned in the Qur'an (Surah Al-Qadr, 97:3). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) used to observe I'tikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan to seek closeness to Allah and increase his acts of worship. While specific hadiths from the API calls are not provided here, the practice of I'tikaf is well-documented in Islamic tradition. It is a time for intense reflection, prayer, reading of the Qur'an, and seeking forgiveness. This practice exemplifies the spiritual depth and devotion characteristic of Ramadan, focusing on personal growth, spiritual cleansing, and strengthening one's relationship with Allah. I'tikaf is a voluntary act of worship that demonstrates the Muslim's desire for spiritual purification and dedication to worship during the most blessed time of the year. It embodies the essence of seclusion for the sake of Allah, offering a unique opportunity for Muslims to detach from worldly distractions and immerse themselves in spiritual activities. These practices, Tarawih prayers and I'tikaf, highlight the profound spiritual opportunities that Ramadan offers to Muslims worldwide, encouraging them to increase their acts of worship, seek forgiveness, and strive for spiritual excellence.",Yes,3,Yes,No,No,It made a funny/accurate yet undesirable mention of the API not yielding hadith :D 
Seerah / History,Wael,Single Turn,There was an incident where one of the companions had intercourse with him wife during the month of Ramadan. I don't recall exactly but can you share this story. Is it actually permissible to have intercourse with spouse during Ramadan?,"he incident you're referring to involves a companion who had intercourse with his wife during the month of Ramadan while he was fasting. This story is narrated through several hadiths, highlighting the companion's concern and the Prophet Muhammad's (ﷺ) guidance on the matter. In one narration from Sahih Muslim, Abu Huraira reported that a person approached the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) after having intercourse with his wife during Ramadan while fasting. The Prophet (ﷺ) asked if the man could free a slave, fast for two consecutive months, or feed sixty poor people as expiation for his act. The man expressed his inability to do any of these, indicating the gravity of the situation and the prescribed expiations for such an act. Collection: Muslim, LK id: 2_13_14_2538 ""Abu Huraira reported that a person had intercourse with his wife during Ramadan (while fasting). He asked for the religious verdict (about it) from the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ), whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Can you find a slave (to grant him freedom)? He said: No. He (the Prophet (ﷺ) again) said: Can you afford to observe fasts for two (consecutive) months? He said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then feed sixty poor men."" Grade: Sahih - Authentic Another narration from Sahih Bukhari provides more context, where the man expressed his ruin upon committing the act, and the Prophet (ﷺ) offered similar expiations. Eventually, the Prophet (ﷺ) advised the man to take a basket of dates given by an Ansari and use it to feed his family, acknowledging the man's poverty. Collection: Bukhari, LK id: 1_51_20_2599 Narrated Abu Huraira: ""A man came to Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) and said, 'I am ruined.' The Prophet (ﷺ) asked, 'What do you mean?' He said, 'I had sexual intercourse with my wife during Ramadan (while fasting).'..."" Grade: Sahih-Authentic In a narration from Tirmizi, the story of Salman bin Sakhr Al-Ansari is mentioned, who faced a similar situation. The Prophet (ﷺ) offered the same expiations, and when the man expressed his inability, the Prophet (ﷺ) helped him find a way to fulfill the expiation by feeding sixty needy people. Collection: Tirmizi, LK id: 6_13_20_1203 ""Abu Salamah and Muhammad bin Abdur-Rahman (bin Thawban) narrated that: Salman bin Sakhr Al-Ansari...said that his wife was like the back of his mother to him until Ramadan passed..."" Grade: Hasan - Good These narrations clarify that having intercourse with one's spouse during the daytime of Ramadan while fasting is not permissible and requires expiation if it occurs. The expiations include freeing a slave, fasting for two consecutive months, or feeding sixty poor people, depending on one's ability.",,,Yes,5,Yes,No,No,didn't double check Hadiths yet
Seerah / History,Wael,Single Turn,I heard the companions were ordered to break their fasting during the battles that happened in Ramandan. is that true? Can I also break my fast if my job requires physical effort,"The companions of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) were indeed given guidance regarding fasting during times of battle. However, the specific narrations you mentioned about being ordered to break their fast during battles in Ramadan are not directly available in the hadith collections I can access. Nonetheless, there are principles and examples from the life of the Prophet (ﷺ) and his companions that can shed light on this matter. For instance, fasting is described as a shield, as mentioned in a hadith from the collection of Nesai: Collection: Nesai LK id: 5_22_43_2230 ""It was narrated from Saeed bin Abi Hind that Mutarrif a man from Banu 'Amir bin Sa'sa'ah told him that: 'Uthman bin Abi Al-As called for milk to be given to him (Mutarrif) to drink. Mutarrif said: 'I heard the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) say: 'Fasting is a shield like the shield of any one of you in battle.""' Abu Hurairah said: ""The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: 'Fasting is a shield.""' (Sahih) This hadith emphasizes the protective and spiritual benefits of fasting, likening it to a shield in battle. However, it does not directly address the question of breaking the fast during physical exertion or battle. Regarding the allowance to break one's fast due to physical exertion or difficulty, Islamic jurisprudence provides flexibility. For example, another hadith from Bukhari highlights the Prophet's (ﷺ) advice on moderation in fasting: Collection: Bukhari LK id: 1_30_59_1979 Narrated `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As: The Prophet (ﷺ) advised against excessive fasting to the point of weakening one's body, indicating the importance of maintaining one's health and strength. Based on these principles, scholars such as Yusuf Al Qaradawi and Muhammad Shinqeeti have discussed the permissibility of breaking one's fast in situations of hardship or when one's job requires significant physical effort that could lead to harm or excessive difficulty if one were to continue fasting. The key consideration is the presence of genuine hardship or the risk of harm to one's health. It's important to consult with knowledgeable scholars or trusted religious authorities regarding your specific situation, as they can provide guidance tailored to your circumstances, taking into account the principles of ease and preventing harm that are emphasized in Islamic jurisprudence.",,,Yes,3,No,No,No,"There was a famous incident (I think reported in Al-Bukhari and Muslim) during Mecca's conquest
Also using the Hadith of ""fasting is a shield"" then saying it does not apply was kind of funny"
Seerah / History,Wael,Multi Turn,I heard Muslims have not always fasted in Ramadan. Is that true?,"The practice of fasting during Ramadan as an obligatory act for Muslims was established by Allah and communicated through the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). Before the obligation of fasting in Ramadan was revealed, Muslims were not required to fast during this month. The obligation to fast during Ramadan was established through revelation in the Qur'an and further explained through the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ). The hadiths you referred to discuss the guidelines about fasting immediately before Ramadan. The first hadith from Sahih Bukhari, narrated by Abu Huraira, advises against fasting a day or two before Ramadan unless one has a habit of voluntary fasting (Nawafil), in which case it is permissible for them to fast. Collection: Bukhari Chapter: 30 Hadith: 1914 LK id: 1_30_14_1914 Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""None of you should fast a day or two before the month of Ramadan unless he has the habit of fasting (Nawafil) (and if his fasting coincides with that day) then he can fast that day."" Grade: Sahih-Authentic Similarly, a hadith from Ibn Majah, also narrated by Abu Hurairah, reinforces this guideline: Collection: IbnMaja Chapter: 7 Hadith: 1650 LK id: 4_7_-1_1650 It was narrated from Abu Hurairah that the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: ‘Do not anticipate Ramadan by fasting one or two days before, except for a man who has a habitual pattern of fasting, in which case let him fast.” Grade: Sahih - Authentic These hadiths do not indicate that Muslims did not fast in Ramadan before it was prescribed; rather, they provide guidance on the approach to fasting just before Ramadan begins. The obligation to fast during Ramadan was established by Allah and is a fundamental aspect of Islamic practice, as detailed in the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ).",When was it prescribed then?,"The obligation of fasting during the month of Ramadan was prescribed in the second year after the Hijrah (migration) of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) from Mecca to Medina. This is based on the understanding of Islamic scholars who have studied the chronological order of Quranic revelations and the historical context of Islamic practices. The verses from Surah Al-Baqarah (2:183-187) lay down the rules for fasting, indicating its obligation, the conditions under which one may be exempted, and the manner in which it should be observed. Specifically, Ayah 2:185 of the Qur'an states: Arabic: شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ ٱلَّذِىٓ أُنزِلَ فِيهِ ٱلْقُرْءَانُ هُدًى لِّلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَـٰتٍۢ مِّنَ ٱلْهُدَىٰ وَٱلْفُرْقَانِ ۚ فَمَن شَهِدَ مِنكُمُ ٱلشَّهْرَ فَلْيَصُمْهُ ۖ وَمَن كَانَ مَرِيضًا أَوْ عَلَىٰ سَفَرٍۢ فَعِدَّةٌ مِّنْ أَيَّامٍ أُخَرَ ۗ يُرِيدُ ٱللَّهُ بِكُمُ ٱلْيُسْرَ وَلَا يُرِيدُ بِكُمُ ٱلْعُسْرَ وَلِتُكْمِلُوا ٱلْعِدَّةَ وَلِتُكَبِّرُوا ٱللَّهَ عَلَىٰ مَا هَدَىٰكُمْ وَلَعَلَّكُمْ تَشْكُرُونَ Translation: ""Ramaḍân is the month in which the Quran was revealed as a guide for humanity with clear proofs of guidance and the standard ˹to distinguish between right and wrong˺. So whoever is present this month, let them fast. But whoever is ill or on a journey, then ˹let them fast˺ an equal number of days ˹after Ramaḍân˺. Allah intends ease for you, not hardship, so that you may complete the prescribed period and proclaim the greatness of Allah for guiding you, and perhaps you will be grateful."" This verse clearly establishes the month of Ramadan as the period during which Muslims are obligated to fast, marking the prescription of fasting in Ramadan in the early years of Islam after the migration to Medina.",Yes,5,Yes,No,No,
Seerah / History,Wael,Multi Turn,I want to present about major events that happened in Ramandan on weekly basis. Can you share 4 major historic events briefly?,"Certainly! Ramadan is a month rich in history and spiritual significance. Here are four major historic events that occurred during Ramadan: 1. **The Revelation of the Qur'an**: The most significant event that occurred in Ramadan is the beginning of the revelation of the Qur'an to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on Laylat al-Qadr (the Night of Decree), which is believed to be one of the odd nights in the last ten days of Ramadan. This event marks the commencement of the prophetic mission and the transmission of the final divine message to humanity. 2. **The Battle of Badr (2nd Ramadan, 624 CE)**: The first major battle between the Muslims and the Quraysh of Mecca occurred on the 17th of Ramadan in the second year of Hijrah (migration from Mecca to Medina). Despite being outnumbered, the Muslims achieved a decisive victory, which had a significant impact on the spread of Islam and the establishment of the Muslim community in Medina. 3. **The Conquest of Mecca (8th Ramadan, 630 CE)**: The peaceful conquest of Mecca occurred in the 8th year of Hijrah, during Ramadan. This event marked the victory of Islam in Arabia and led to the destruction of idols in the Kaaba, restoring it as a monotheistic house of worship. The conquest also opened the way for the people of Mecca to embrace Islam. 4. **The Death of Imam Ali (21st Ramadan, 661 CE)**: Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the fourth caliph of Islam, was martyred during the month of Ramadan in the year 40 AH (661 CE). He was struck with a poisoned sword while praying in the mosque of Kufa, Iraq. His martyrdom is a moment of deep reflection and sorrow in Islamic history. These events reflect the profound spiritual and historical significance of Ramadan in the Islamic tradition.",Can you suggest a couple more?,"Certainly, here are two more significant events that occurred during Ramadan, further highlighting the month's historical and spiritual importance: 5. **The Battle of Khandaq (or the Battle of the Trench) (5th Ramadan, 627 CE)**: This took place in the 5th year of Hijrah during the month of Ramadan. The Muslims in Medina, led by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), faced a large coalition of Quraysh and their allies. The Muslims dug a trench around Medina as a defensive strategy, which was an innovative tactic at the time. The siege lasted for several weeks, and the battle ended without significant combat, demonstrating the strategic wisdom and patience of the Prophet and his companions. This event is also a testament to the unity and perseverance of the early Muslim community. 6. **The Liberation of Andalus (Ramadan, 92 AH / 711 CE)**: The beginning of the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula (modern-day Spain and Portugal) started in Ramadan of the year 92 AH. Led by Tariq ibn Ziyad, the Muslim forces landed at Gibraltar (named after Tariq, from ""Jabal Tariq"" meaning ""Mountain of Tariq"") and achieved a decisive victory against the Visigothic king Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete. This event marked the start of a significant period of Islamic rule in the region, which lasted for centuries and had a profound impact on European history, culture, and science. These events further illustrate the deep historical significance of Ramadan beyond its spiritual aspects, showcasing moments of strategic brilliance, significant conquests, and the spread of Islamic civilization.",Yes,3,No,No,No,"It deviated from the common reports that Al-Khandaq happened in Shawal but it corrected itself when challenged (it is a common 'good' behavior)
Are you sure the Battle of Khandaq was in Ramadan?


I apologize for the oversight in my previous response. Upon further reflection, I recognize that my statement regarding the timing of the Battle of Khandaq (or the Battle of the Trench) occurring in Ramadan was incorrect. The Battle of Khandaq actually took place in Shawwal, the month following Ramadan, in the 5th year of Hijrah (627 CE). I appreciate your patience and understanding as I correct this mistake. The historical significance of the battle remains a pivotal moment in Islamic history, demonstrating strategic ingenuity and the resilience of the early Muslim community. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

Seerah / History,Wael,Generative,Can you help me prepare a short speech about the connection between Ramandan and making great achievements. Use some historical example to make the point,"Certainly! Here's a draft for your speech on the connection between Ramadan and making great achievements, incorporating teachings from the Qur'an, Hadith, and historical examples: --- **Title: Ramadan: A Month of Spiritual Strength and Great Achievements** Assalamu Alaikum, Dear brothers and sisters, Today, I want to talk about the profound connection between the blessed month of Ramadan and the potential it holds for us to achieve greatness, both spiritually and in our worldly endeavors. Ramadan is not just a month of fasting; it is a period of intense spiritual rejuvenation and a time when the gates of mercy are wide open. It is a time when the Qur'an was revealed, a guidance for mankind, clear proofs of guidance, and the criterion (between right and wrong). Ayah: 2:185 Arabic: شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ وَبَيِّنَاتٍ مِنَ الْهُدَى وَالْفُرْقَانِ Translation: The month of Ramadan [is that] in which was revealed the Qur'an, a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. This revelation itself is a testament to the greatness that can be achieved during this holy month. The Qur'an, the ultimate guide for humanity, was bestowed upon us in Ramadan, highlighting the month's significance in achieving divine closeness and guidance. Moreover, Ramadan teaches us discipline, self-control, and empathy, qualities essential for achieving greatness in any field. By fasting, we learn to control our desires and focus on our spiritual growth, which in turn enhances our capacity to achieve worldly goals with integrity and excellence. Historically, Ramadan has been a time of great achievements. One of the most significant events that took place during Ramadan was the Battle of Badr, the first major battle in the history of Islam, which occurred on the 17th of Ramadan, 2 AH. Despite being outnumbered, the Muslim army, under the leadership of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), achieved a decisive victory. This victory was not just a military success; it was a monumental achievement that demonstrated the power of faith and the divine support for the believers. This historical example serves as a powerful reminder of what can be achieved when we combine our faith with action. The victory at Badr was not merely a result of strategic planning or martial prowess; it was a manifestation of the spiritual strength and determination that the believers derived from their faith and their fasting during Ramadan. In conclusion, Ramadan is a time of great potential. It is a month that teaches us the values of patience, perseverance, and reliance on Allah. These lessons, if carried beyond Ramadan, can lead us to achieve greatness in all aspects of our lives. Let us embrace the spirit of Ramadan, not just in fasting but in every action we undertake. Let us strive to achieve greatness, inspired by the examples of our predecessors, and let us remember that with faith, discipline, and the blessings of Ramadan, there is no limit to what we can achieve. May Allah accept our fasting, our prayers, and our good deeds, and may He enable us to achieve greatness in this life and the next. Jazakum Allahu Khairan. --- I hope this draft helps you in preparing your speech. May your words inspire and uplift the hearts of your listeners.",,,Yes,3,Yes,No,No,
Seerah / History,Wael,Intimidation ,"Actually, This Ramadan thing is nonsense. It is a waste of time and health","I understand that you might have concerns or doubts about Ramadan and its practices. It's important to approach such topics with an open heart and mind. Ramadan is a significant month for Muslims around the world, and it holds profound spiritual, social, and health benefits that have been recognized both in Islamic tradition and by modern research. In the Qur'an, the significance of Ramadan is highlighted: Ayah: 2:183 Arabic: يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ الصِّيَامُ كَمَا كُتِبَ عَلَيْ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ Translation: O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous. This verse emphasizes that fasting during Ramadan is not a new concept but has been prescribed for communities before Muslims, aiming to cultivate piety and self-restraint. Regarding health concerns, it's important to note that Islam exempts certain individuals from fasting, such as those who are ill, traveling, elderly, pregnant, or breastfeeding, acknowledging the need to prioritize health. Moreover, numerous studies have shown that fasting, when done correctly, can have various health benefits, including improved blood sugar control, better heart health, and brain function, among others. Classical and modern scholars have extensively discussed the wisdom behind Ramadan. For instance, Ibn Al Qayyim highlighted the spiritual purification and the development of taqwa (consciousness of God) that comes with fasting. Modern scholars like Yusuf Al Qaradawi and Omar Suleiman have spoken about the social benefits of Ramadan, including fostering community spirit and empathy for the less fortunate. It's perfectly okay to have questions or doubts. The key is to seek knowledge and understanding from reliable sources and to reflect on the wisdom and benefits that come with observing such practices. If you have specific concerns or questions about Ramadan, I'm here to help address them.",Astaghfilullah,"May Allah accept your seeking of forgiveness and guide us all towards understanding, patience, and compassion.
